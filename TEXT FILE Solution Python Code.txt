# OBJECTIVE: Description of the problem can be found in the pdf file "Problem: predicting-house-prices"
#
# NOTES: The code below only accepts user input. Based on the "input format" rules (they can be found in the pdf file Problem: predicting-house-prices)

#For the code to accept CSV, or Text file make the following change FROM LINE 35 TO 56

# with open('[FILENAME]') as f:
#    # read first line
#    next_line = f.readline()
#    # read the fist int which is the F attribute
#    F = int(next_line[0])
#    # read the second int which is the N attribute
#    N = int(next_line[2:len(next_line)-1])
#    
#    for line in f:
#        # remove whitespace at the start and the newline at the end
#        line = line.strip()
#        # split each column on whitespace
#        columns = re.split('\s+', line, maxsplit=F)
#        df_list.append(columns)
#
# PD: small changes for printing the result should also be made in order to accept files
